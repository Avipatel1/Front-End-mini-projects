# Front-End Mini Projects

Welcome to the **Front-End Mini Projects** repository! This repo is a growing collection of small, fun projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project is organized in its own folder, and the folder name gives a clear idea of what the project is about.

## About

The goal of this repository is to practice and showcase a wide range of front-end skills, from basic layouts to interactive web applications. Each project focuses on different concepts or techniques—just look at the folder names to get a sense of what you'll find inside.

## Projects

Currently, the repository includes the following projects (more will be added soon):

- **Folder Name 1**  
  _Description: [Add a short description here]_  

- **Folder Name 2**  
  _Description: [Add a short description here]_  

- **Folder Name 3**  
  _Description: [Add a short description here]_  

_(More projects will be added as the repo grows!)_

## Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder, typically containing:

- `index.html` — The main HTML file
- `style.css` — Styles for the project
- `script.js` — JavaScript logic

Feel free to explore, clone, and tweak any of the projects!
